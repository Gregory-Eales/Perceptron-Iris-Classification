# Perceptron-Iris-Classification

## Overview:
This is a simple perceptron model which is trained to classify samples from the iris dataset. This consists of two input features of both the petal and sepal length for each of the Seratos and Vericolor iris species. <br/>

## Requirements:

Python3: https://www.python.org/ <br/>

NumPy: http://www.numpy.org/ <br/>

Pandas: https://pandas.pydata.org/ <br/>

Matplotlib: https://matplotlib.org/ <br/>

This is a diagram of the perceptron machine learning model for classifacation tasks. This shows the proccess of inputing the features x <sub>m where m is the number of features per data sample, and mulitplying them by their corresponding weights. The amalgamation of the two components is then summed and inputed into a stepwise function producing a classification. The classification is then fed back into model to check for errors and updating the weights accordingly.
